# Chrome Logger Firefox WebExtension Change Log

### 2024 Sep 25 / Version 3.0
* Removed: fallback behavior of executing eval'd code against the activeTab via devtools when log.js content script fails to inject (as in the case of JSON viewer UI) as Firefox has finally disabled this functionality (whilst providing no recourse in the 5 years since this was last updated).
* Added: devtools.panel displaying parsed ChromeLogger data instead of devtools webconsole when log.js content script fails to inject or it happens to be open.
* Added: style substitutions support for `console.debug()`.
* Updated: options supports light/dark themes.
* Fixed: options reset button didn't work.

### 2019 Nov 24 / Version 2.0
* Removed: `<script[data-chromelogger-data]>` and `<script[data-chromelogger-rows]>` node parsing.
* Added: `<script[type="application/json"]#chromelogger>` node parsing.
* Updated: moved DOM parsing functionality from devtools eval'd code (Mozilla no likey!) to injected content script.
* Fixed: dark, transparent icon did not display well w/dark theme.

### 2018 Oct 09 / Version 1.7.3
* Fixed: null "object" resulted in error when checked for property, ending processing of rest of data stack.

### 2018 Aug 06 / Version 1.7.2
* Fixed: invalid `data.rows[...].type` values resulted in `console` error.

### 2018 Aug 04 / Version 1.7.1
* Fixed: broken `table` and various other `console` methods.
* Fixed: inadequate substitution pattern detection and subsequent unescaping.

### 2018 Aug 03 / Version 1.7
* Fixed: columns arrays that were arranged in ways or [in|ex]cluded columns other than what was explicitly specified by the protocol failed to process. @shoutout Zxurian
* Added: Support for `[object].___class_name` and Class Name substitution styling.
* Added: Support for `X-ChromePHP-Data` headers.
* Updated: Now scans headers from all resource types.
* Updated: `data-chromelogger-version="1.0"` and `data-chromelogger-columns="log,backtrace,type"` optional attributes parsed from `<script[data-chromelogger-rows]>` nodes.
* Added: `<script[data-chromelogger-data]>` node parsing.
* Added: `display_data_url=[bool]` setting and Data Header substitution styling.
* Updated: removed "METHOD url" display from being appended to first parsed data row, logged separately if `display_data_url=true`.

### 2018 Apr 24 / Version 1.6.1
* Fixed: trying (and failing, of course) to process null values as objects w/enumerated properties.
* Fixed: tabs.executeScript() fails injecting both file + code, throws to devtools fallback.

### 2018 Apr 23 / Version 1.6
* Restored: removal of `__proto__` and `length` properties from objects and arrays.

### 2018 Mar 26 / Version 1.5
* Added: console message styling for various contexts w/options page to customize.
* Added: parsing of ChromeLogger formatted rows data from loaded DOM content. Syntax: `<script data-chromelogger-rows="{key}">var {key} = [[log, backtrace, type], ...];</script>`
* Issue: cannot retrieve rows data from subframes DOM until Firefox supports devtools.inspectedWindow.eval() options parameter!
* Regression: `__proto__` and `length` object and array properties no longer removed. Problematic.

### 2018 Mar 18 / Version 1.4
* Updated: chromelogger protocol trace value now appended to passed console method arguments. @shoutout Erik

### 2017 Dec 23 / Version 1.3
* Added: `__proto__` and `length` properties are removed from objects and arrays respectively output to web console.

### 2017 Dec 16 / Version 1.2
* Added: Tab.fallback, flagged true if log.js fails to inject onDOMReady as in the case when Firefox loads JSON viewer in the tab inspectedWindow.
* Updated: Tab.log() sends parsed ChromeLoggerData back to dev.js if Tab.fallback is true.
* Updated: dev.js runtime.Port.onMessage handler stringifies and runs ChromeLoggerData from Tab.log() through devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(), dirty but effective.

### 2017 Nov 29 / Version 1.1.1
* Updated: Chrome Logger data row values validation, replacement on missing with defaults. @shoutout Honza
* Fixed: warning on icon being wrong size.

### 2017 Nov 19 / Version 1.1
* Added: webNavigation event handlers to replace spotty tab.onUpdated event handler.
* Updated: Chrome Logger data rows callback catches malformed row data.

### 2017 Nov 17 / Version 1.0.1
* Fixed: was matching against case sensitive X-ChromeLogger-Data header. Now case insensitive match. @shoutout Jan

### 2017 Oct 10 / Version 1.0
* Maiden voyage.
